Even in the absence of bleeding or significant oxygen depletion large AVMs can damage the brain or spinal cord simply by their presence They can range in size from a fraction of an inch to more than 25 inches in diameter depending on the number and size of the blood vessels making up the lesion The larger the lesion the greater the amount of pressure it exerts on surrounding brain or spinal cord structures The largest lesions may compress several inches of the spinal cord or distort the shape of an entire hemisphere of the brain Such massive AVMs can constrict the flow of cerebrospinal fluid - a clear liquid that normally nourishes and protects the brain and spinal cord - by distorting or closing the passageways and open chambers ventricles inside the brain that allow this fluid to circulate freely As cerebrospinal fluid accumulates hydrocephalus results This fluid buildup further increases the amount of pressure on fragile neurological structures adding to the damage caused by the AVM itself

A Pain Primer What Do We Know About Pain
The idea of using receptors as gateways for pain drugs is a novel idea supported by experiments involving substance P Investigators have been able to isolate a tiny population of neurons located in the spinal cord that together form a major portion of the pathway responsible for carrying persistent pain signals to the brain When animals were given injections of a lethal cocktail containing substance P linked to the chemical saporin this group of cells whose sole function is to communicate pain were killed Receptors for substance P served as a portal or point of entry for the compound Within days of the injections the targeted neurons located in the outer layer of the spinal cord along its entire length absorbed the compound and were neutralized The animals behavior was completely normal they no longer exhibited signs of pain following injury or had an exaggerated pain response Importantly the animals still responded to acute that is normal pain This is a critical finding as it is important to retain the bodys ability to detect potentially injurious stimuli The protective early warning signal that pain provides is essential for normal functioning If this work can be translated clinically humans might be able to benefit from similar compounds introduced for example through lumbar spinal puncture

What are the different forms of syringomyelia
Generally there are two forms of syringomyelia In most cases the disorder is related to an abnormality of the brain called a Chiari I malformation named after one of the physicians who first characterized it This anatomic abnormality causes the lower part of the cerebellum to protrude from its normal location in the back of the head into the cervical or neck portion of the spinal canal A syrinx may then develop in the cervical region of the spinal cord Because of the relationship that was once thought to exist between the brain and spinal cord in this type of syringomyelia physicians sometimes refer to it as communicating syringomyelia Symptoms usually begin between the ages of 25 and 40 and may worsen with straining or any activity that causes CSF pressure to fluctuate suddenly Some individuals however may have long periods of functional stability Some people with this form of the disorder also have hydrocephalus in which CSF accumulates in the brain or a condition called arachnoiditis in which a covering of the spinal cord - the arachnoid membrane - is inflamed

What kinds of seasonal flu vaccines are available
However health care providers should not get the nasal spray vaccine if they are providing medical care for patients who require special environments in the hospital because they are profoundly immunocompromised for example if they work in bone marrow transplant units This is intended as an extra precaution and is not based on reports of vaccine virus transmission in those settings The flu shot is preferred for vaccinating health care workers who are in close contact with severely immunocompromised patients who are being cared for in a protective environment These health care workers may still get nasal spray vaccine but they must avoid contact with such patients for 7 days after getting vaccinated See Persons Who Live With or Care for Persons at Higher Risk for Influenza-Related Complications for more information

What Research is Being Done
Biological therapy involves enhancing the bodys overall immune response to recognize and fight cancer cells The immune system is designed to attack foreign substances in the body since cancer cells arent foreign they usually do not generate much of an immune response Researchers are using different methods to provoke a strong immune response to tumor cells Such proteins as interleukin and interferon both of which are immune system messengers called cytokines and other substances can stimulate and restore the bodys natural response against proteins on the surfaces of cancer cells and thus slow tumor growth Other therapy uses viruses T-cells a major component of immune system function and other substances to increase immune response and target the tumor cells Scientists are also experimenting with genetically altered T-cells from the patients own body which are cultured with an antigen and injected directly into the brain following surgery Biological therapies to fight CNS tumors include vaccines gene therapy antibody therapy and tumor growth factors

What research is being done for Meningitis
The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke NINDS a component of the National Institutes of Health NIH within the US Department of Health and Human Services conducts and supports a wide range of research on neurological disorders including meningitis and encephalitis Current research efforts include gaining a better understanding of how the central nervous system responds to inflammation and the role of T cells blood cells involved in immune system response in suppressing infection in the brain Scientists hope to better understand the molecular mechanisms involved in the protection and disruption of the blood-brain barrier which could lead to the development of new treatments for several neuroinflammatory diseases such as meningitis and encephalitis Other scientists hope to define at a molecular level how certain viruses overcome the bodys defense mechanism and interact with target host cells A possible therapeutic approach under investigation involves testing neuroprotective compounds that block the damage that accumulates after the infection and inflammation of meningitis and encephalitis and can lead to potential complications including loss of cognitive function and dementia
